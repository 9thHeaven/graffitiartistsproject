        <p class="color">Khadija El-Ghawas</p>
        <p class="text">Khadiga Tarek, known as Khadiga El-Ghawas, is an Egyptian graffiti artist who became the First Light Calligrapher
        in Egypt and the first woman in the world to be mastering this art. 
        In 2011, Khadiga won the first place in an 
        important Contemporary Calligraphy Competition  in the Bibliotheca Alexandrina's calligraphy 
        center called "Revolution in Arabic Calligraphy Eyes".
        After that she went to a calligraphy school to complete her calligraphy studies. 
        In April 2013 she began her Light Calligraphy work inspired by Julian Breton's Light Calligraphy, 
        and she started to make her own version of this art.</p>

        <p class="text">Lamis Solyman is visual artist and production designer.  She believes that graffiti helps her deliver a simple message
        of being a woman, a human being deserving of all rights .
        She uses graffiti as a  tool to talk about youth, gender, and politics.</p>

        <p class="color">Mira Shihadeh</p>
        <p class="text">Mira Shihadeh uses graffiti to bring attention to Egyptian women who fight for social and political justice in 
        a country where they are inherently oppressed because of their sex. In one of her murals , she makes a
        statement with a work of street art depicting an Arab woman in a tightly-fitted red dress, 
        one hand on hip, the other brandishing a spray can with the nozzle pressed down, spraying her assailants away. </p>
